# Android nRF Edge Impulse
nRF Edge Impulse app is developed in collaboration with [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/) 
to train and deploy embedded machine learning models on the 
[Nordic Thingy:53](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-53) 
using [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/). 

Every _Nordic Thingy:53_ comes pre-installed with firmware compatible with the nRF Edge Impulse 
mobile app. The app allows you to upload raw sensor data via your mobile device to the cloud-based 
Edge Impulse Studio and deploy fully trained ML models to the _Nordic Thingy:53_ over 
Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE). 

The app allows you to choose between existing projects in Edge Impulse studio data or creating 
a new project and can collect sensor data from the following set of sensors on the _Nordic Thingy:53_:

- Accelerometer
- Microphone
- Magnetometer
- Light
- Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and Air quality
- Inertial (Accelerometer and Magnetometer)
- Light and Environment
- Light and Inertial
- Environment and Inertial
- Light and Environment and Inertial

The collected sensor data can be labeled as training or testing data and may be inferenced directly 
in the app with machine learning model deployed to the _Nordic Thingy:53_.  

A free Edge Impulse account, which can be created from the app or at www.edgeimpulse.com, 
is required to connect nRF Edge Impulse with Edge Impulse studio.
